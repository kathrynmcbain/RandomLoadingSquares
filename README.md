<<Kept as an original copy of code using Divs and CSS for squares.>>

# RandomLoadingSquares
Displays a board of squares, each a random colour. Squares will randomly disappear, one by one, revealing content underneath. 
It's not perfect (but soon will be!)
- Functions on all device sizes
- colour of squares and how they disappear is completely random each time.
Makes a good loading screen!
